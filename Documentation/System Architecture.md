"Technical Plan Aligned with Business Goals"
Goal:
Create a furniture marketplace that allows users to browse, add to cart, and purchase furniture products, using Next.js for frontend, Sanity CMS for backend, and third-party APIs for payment and shipping.

"System Architecture Visualized"
Architecture Overview:

Create a clear architecture diagram to show how each component interacts. The flow should look like:

    Frontend (Next.js)
        Displays furniture categories, product listings, and cart functionality.
        Interacts with Sanity CMS for fetching product and order data.
        Sends data to APIs for payments and shipping.

    Sanity CMS
        Manages furniture product data, customer data, and orders.
        Acts as a database and content management system.

    Third-Party APIs
        Payment Gateway (Stripe) for processing transactions.
        Shipping API for tracking delivery.
